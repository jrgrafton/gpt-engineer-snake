# gpt-engineer-snake
Exploration into how modern LLM tooling can help expedite basic game creation.

Utilized [initial prompt](prompt.txt) with [Engineer GPT](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer) to create a basic implementation.
Then used [GPT4](https://chat.openai.com/share/2ec6b8c6-36b5-4067-86c9-14f2f2bb11e0) to fix bugs, enhance and refactor.

Total time taken ~1h10m.<br> 
I estimate it would have taken ~5x as long to get as far without assistance, especially given how long it's been since I've coded anything.

# Usage
1. Install NPM on your local machine
2. ./run.sh
3. WASD to contol the snake
